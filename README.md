# HydroOJ Problem Translation Project

> English | [简体中文](/README-zh.md)

The project commit to translate problems written by Chinese in [HydroOJ](https://hydro.ac/) to English.

Previously, most non-Chinese speakers did not know the well-known OI problems written by Chinese before. Therefore, we want to help more non-Chinese speakers read these problems through the project.
